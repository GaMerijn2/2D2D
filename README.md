## Mechanics

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each core mechanic with examples and code snippets.

### Basic 2D Movement
Smooth horizontal movement that forms the foundation of **2D2D** gameplay.

![Basic Movement GIF](link_to_basic_movement_gif.gif)

```csharp
// Basic 2D Movement
private void MovePlayer() {
    Vector2 movementDirection = new Vector2(Input.GetAxis("Horizontal") * movementSpeed, rb.velocity.y);
    rb.velocity = movementDirection;
}
Dimension Switching
Switch between dimensions to access alternate paths and hidden platforms.
```

### Coyote Time Mechanic
Allows a brief grace period after leaving a platform for smoother jumps.

```csharp

// Coyote Time Mechanic
private void UpdateCoyoteTime() {
    if (IsGrounded()) {
        coyoteTimeCounter = coyoteTime; // Reset if grounded
    } else {
        coyoteTimeCounter -= Time.deltaTime; // Decrease over time
    }
}
```

### Jump Buffer Mechanic
Adds a buffer for jump input, making jumps more responsive and forgiving.


```csharp

// Jump Buffer Mechanic
private void UpdateJumpBuffer() {
    if (Input.GetButtonDown("Jump")) {
        jumpBufferCounter = jumpBufferTime; // Reset buffer
    } else {
        jumpBufferCounter -= Time.deltaTime;
    }
}
```

### Ground Check
Checks if the player is grounded to ensure proper jump mechanics.

```csharp

// Ground Check
private bool IsGrounded() {
    return Physics2D.OverlapCircle(groundCheck.position, groundCheckRadius, groundLayer);
}
```

### Variable Jump Height
Allows players to control jump height by releasing the jump button early.

```csharp

// Variable Jump Height
private void ApplyVariableJumpHeight() {
    if (Input.GetButtonUp("Jump") && rb.velocity.y > 0f) {
        rb.velocity = new Vector2(rb.velocity.x, rb.velocity.y * 0.5f); // Shorten jump height
    }
}
```
