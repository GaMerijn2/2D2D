- **Dimension Switching**: Toggle between dimensions to unlock new paths and solve puzzles.
- **Responsive Jump Mechanics**: Enhanced controls with Coyote Time and Jump Buffering, allowing for tighter platforming.
- **Variable Jump Heights**: Release the jump button early to control your jump height dynamically.

## Mechanics

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each core mechanic with examples and code snippets.

### Basic 2D Movement
Smooth horizontal movement that forms the foundation of **2D2D** gameplay.

![Basic Movement GIF](link_to_basic_movement_gif.gif)

```csharp
// Basic 2D Movement
private void MovePlayer() {
    Vector2 movementDirection = new Vector2(Input.GetAxis("Horizontal") * movementSpeed, rb.velocity.y);
    rb.velocity = movementDirection;
}
Dimension Switching
Switch between dimensions to access alternate paths and hidden platforms.
```

Code Overview:
```csharp

Copy code
// Dimension Switching Code
private void SwitchDimension() {
    // Logic for toggling between dimensions
}
```

Coyote Time Mechanic
Allows a brief grace period after leaving a platform for smoother jumps.

```csharp
Copy code
// Coyote Time Mechanic
private void UpdateCoyoteTime() {
    if (IsGrounded()) {
        coyoteTimeCounter = coyoteTime; // Reset if grounded
    } else {
        coyoteTimeCounter -= Time.deltaTime; // Decrease over time
    }
}
```

Jump Buffer Mechanic
Adds a buffer for jump input, making jumps more responsive and forgiving.


```csharp
Copy code
// Jump Buffer Mechanic
private void UpdateJumpBuffer() {
    if (Input.GetButtonDown("Jump")) {
        jumpBufferCounter = jumpBufferTime; // Reset buffer
    } else {
        jumpBufferCounter -= Time.deltaTime;
    }
}
```

Ground Check
Checks if the player is grounded to ensure proper jump mechanics.

```csharp
Copy code
// Ground Check
private bool IsGrounded() {
    return Physics2D.OverlapCircle(groundCheck.position, groundCheckRadius, groundLayer);
}
```

Variable Jump Height
Allows players to control jump height by releasing the jump button early.

```csharp
Copy code
// Variable Jump Height
private void ApplyVariableJumpHeight() {
    if (Input.GetButtonUp("Jump") && rb.velocity.y > 0f) {
        rb.velocity = new Vector2(rb.velocity.x, rb.velocity.y * 0.5f); // Shorten jump height
    }
}
```
